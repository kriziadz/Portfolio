 🧪 Krizia Diaz – QA Portfolio

Hey there! I'm Krizia, a Quality Analyst with 5+ years of experience in manual testing, issue reporting, and quality strategy.  
My background includes deep work with proprietary testing platforms at Apple and WPP’s Bottle Rocket, as well as industry-standard tools like JIRA, TestRail, Charles Proxy, and Postman.

While my most recent experience centers on internal Apple frameworks, this portfolio showcases my approach to QA — from detailed test cases and defect reports to exploratory session notes and continuous learning logs.
